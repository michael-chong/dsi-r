---

## RStudio

---

### Welcome to RStudio

![h:500](./pics/01_RStudio.png)

---

The editor, where you can write and edit files, are in the upper left. If you do not have a file open, this section will be collapsed.


![h:500](./pics/01_RStudio-Editor.png)

---

The console, where you test code and view output, is on the lower left.

![h:500](./pics/01_RStudio-Console.png)

---

The environment, where you can see variables that you have saved, is on the upper right.

![h:500](./pics/01_RStudio-Environment.png)

---

The lower right section contains:

- *Files*, where you see the folder structure of your working directory
- *Plots*, where plots you create are displayed
- *Packages*, an inventory of all R packages that are installed
- *Help*, where you can search information about R functions and packages


![h:350](./pics/01_RStudio-FilesPlotsPackagesHelpViewer.png)


---

### Interacting with R in the console

The console is used to run and test code -- use this for code that you don't need to save.

* Type commands directly into the console and press ‘Enter’ to execute.
* Clear console with ‘Ctrl’ + ‘L’
* If R is still waiting for you to enter more text (e.g. because of an accidental open parenthesis or quote), the console will show a `+` prompt instead of `>`.
    * If stuck, use 'ESC' to quit the current input

---

### Demo: Console

1. Try adding two numbers together
2. Try assigning a variable by typing:

`x <- 123`

---

### Directories and R Projects

* Good to keep data, analyses, and text in a single folder. 
* "R Projects" make some aspects of organizing a project more convenient
  * 'File' → 'New project' → 'New directory' -> 'New project' -> name directory (e.g. "DSI_R") -> 'Create'

What this does:

1. Creates a new directory
2. Creates a '.RProj' file (defines the top-level directory of the project)
3. Starts a new session and sets the "working directory"

---

### Using the editor

* The most basic R file is a script, which contains code to be executed in sequence
* Create a new script with 'File' -> 'New File' -> 'R Script', or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N
* Run current line with Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
* Run entire script with Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter
* Save with 'File' -> 'Save' or Ctrl + S

---

### Diagnostics

When working in a script, RStudio will mark syntax errors. If you hover over the red x, you can see what the problem is.

![h:250](./pics/01_syntax_error.png)

----

### Demo: Projects and Editor

1. Create a new R Project
2. Create a new R script within the R Project
3. Assign some number to the variable `x` (again with `x <- ` syntax)
4. Multiply the number by itself using `*`

---

## R basics

---

### Creating objects

`<-` is the assignment operator.

To assign the value 27 to the object named `num_participants`, you type:

```r
num_participants <- 27
```

Remember that names:

- must start with a letter
- can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and periods

Running the name of the object will display the object.

```r
num_participants
```
---

### Functions

Functions perform tasks that are too complicated or repetitive to write out repeatedly. They take the form:
`function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...)`

R comes with some built-in functions. For example:

```r
paste("abc", "def")
sqrt(16)
seq(1, 14)
```
---

### Custom functions

You can define your own functions with the following syntax:

```r
my_function <- function(argument1, argument2, ...) {
  # <code to execute the function>
  return(output)
}
```
* not all functions have inputs or "arguments"
* the `return()` line defines what the final result of the function should be

---

### Comments in code

Use `#` to explain your code where you think it might be useful. For example:

```r
x <- 9 # I chose 9 because it's my favourite number

# This function below divides a number by 10
divide_by_9 <- function(some_number) {
  some_number_divided <- some_number / 9
  return(some_number_divided)
}

# Test my function:
divide_by_9(72)
```

---

### Demo: Functions

1. Write a function `add_10` that takes a number and adds 10 to it. 
2. Write a function that takes two words and uses `paste` to form the sentence "I like ___ and ___."

---

### Summary so far

At this point, we've learned:

* how to navigate the RStudio interface
* when to use console and editor
* how to create objects and functions
* how to write comments in code

**Questions?**

---

## Quarto and coding style

---

### Quarto

Quarto files are a way to work with code and text in the same document. 

* Create a new Quarto file by going to 'File' -> 'New file' -> 'Quarto document'

For now, create using the defaults -- this can all be changed later.

![h:400](./pics/01_quarto_new.png)
---

### Parts of a Quarto document

The header ("YAML header") contains metadata -- information about the document itself, like its `title`. You can have other options, like the `author` or `date`. 

![h:500](./pics/01_quarto_header.png)

^[More on this later, or here: [\[about YAML\]](https://rpubs.com/drgregmartin/1266674) [PDF YAML options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/pdf.html)]

---

### Parts of a Quarto document

Code chunks are denoted with three ticks (```) at the beginning and the end of the code. 

Like with a script, you can use the Run button or Cmd/Ctrl + Enter or the little green arrow. Output will show in-line.

![h:450](./pics/01_quarto_code.png)

---

### Parts of a Quarto document

You can write (human) text anywhere below the header and outside the code chunks.

![h:500](./pics/01_quarto_text.png)

---

### Why use Quarto?

* Useful like a notebook (like we will do in this module) 
* Easily embed output and convert to other formats (e.g. pdf) for sharing
  
---

### Demo: Quarto

1. Create a new Quarto document
2. In a new code chunk, define a function that takes a number and raises it to the power of itself, and test that it works
3. Make sure the `format` in the header is `html`
4. In RStudio, 'Render' the document
5. Open a browser to see the finished product


---

## Packages and Help

---

### R Packages

* We've seen that R comes with some built-in functions (like `sqrt()`)
* R *packages* are collections of functions, data, and compiled code that extend R's functionality
* *Libraries* refer to where the packages are stored.

Many useful packages need to be downloaded and installed with `install.packages()`. We then need to load the package with `library()`. 

---

### R Packages

For example, the `palmerpenguins` package contains a dataset that we will be using in this module:

```r
# Install package (only need to do this once on your computer)
install.packages("palmerpenguins")

# Load package (do this every time you restart R)
library(palmerpenguins)

# Now we're able to access a dataset from this package
data(penguins)
penguins
```
---

### R packages

Where do packages come from?

* [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) is the most popular and default place for developers to publish their packages
* when using `install.packages()`, the default is to look for the package in CRAN

Packages can also be installed from other sources, but instructions will vary

* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/)
* GitHub repositories 

---

### `tidyverse`

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of related R packages that provide data science tools.

We will be using tools from the tidyverse throughout this module. Install the entire collection with:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

![h:350](./pics/01_TidyversePackages.png)

---

### `tidyverse`

Why is the tidyverse worth mentioning in particular?

* entire ecosystem of powerful packages
* very popular
* **different syntax from "base" R**

---

### Looking up help

If a function or dataset is built-in or comes from a package, there is usually a help page that describes it, which you can access with `?` or `help()`

```
?round 
help("paste")
?palmerpenguins
help(package = "tidyverse")
```

Many popular packages also come with online help pages or manuals. 

---
### Demo: installing and using an unfamiliar package

1. Install the [`climate` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=climate).
2. Find the closest weather station to Toronto Pearson airport (lat: `43.67`, lon: `-79.63`).
3. Find the weather information from yesterday from that station.

---

### Summary

Since the last check-in, we've learned:

* what components make up a Quarto document
* why Quarto documents are useful
* how to install and load packages
* what the tidyverse is
* how to look for documentation on packages and functions

**Questions?**

---

### Exercises

1. Using the built-in functions `seq()` and `median()`, write a function called `find_middle()` that:

* takes two numbers as inputs, then
* produces a sequence that counts between them in increments of 1, then
* finds the middle of the sequence

2. Install the `faraway` package from CRAN. Then, in a new Quarto document, 

* load this package and load the `broccoli` dataset from this package. 
* Use the `head()` function to print the first 6 rows of the data
* Change the `format` to `pdf` and render the document

---

### Exercise 1 Hint

Fill in the blanks:

```r
find_middle <- function(number1, number2) {

  sequence <- seq(____, ____)
  middle <- median(____)
  
  ____(middle)
  
}
```
